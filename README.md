🐾 CritterCare

A whimsical SwiftUI portfolio app that brings your medical app skills to the zoo.

CritterCare is a playful yet technically robust SwiftUI app designed to showcase the same patterns and practices used in real-world medical applications—but applied to zoo animal care. Instead of managing patient records, you’re feeding giraffes and bathing lions. Because why not?

🧠 Why This Project?

CritterCare exists to demonstrate strong SwiftUI fundamentals and clean architectural decisions in a way that’s engaging and memorable. It’s based on the same structure used in healthcare apps—patient lists, status updates, and interactive care—but with a fun twist that makes it perfect for a portfolio.
